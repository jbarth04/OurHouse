To do memcached locally:

- If not done so by requirements.txt, you'll need to run 
$ pip install pylibmc

- If you do not have libmemcached yet, you'll need to run 
$ brew install libmemcached

- If when you rerun pip install pylibmc you get a clang error with linking to libmemcached, 
run the following:
$ brew link libmemcached
$ export LIBMEMCACHED=/usr/local
$ pip install pylibmc --install-option="--with-libmemcached=/usr/local/Cellar/libm\u200cemcached/1.0.18/"

(You may only need the last command. Unsure if the previous are needed)

Then you need to start memcached. Info on memcached commands found here: https://mfitzp.io/article/control-memcached-from-the-command-line/
