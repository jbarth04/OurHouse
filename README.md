### Getting Started
Note: This project is done using Python 2.7.13.

1. Clone the repository.

2. We suggest that you set up a virtual environment. To do so, install virtualenv by running `pip install virtualenv` in the root directory of the application. Once virtualenv has been successfully installed, run `virtualenv venv`. 

3. Ensure that Python 2.7.13 is the version of Python within the virtual environment. 

4. To start up the virtual environment, run `. venv/bin/activate`.

5. To set up the environment, begin the virtual environment, locate the file requirements.txt, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

6. To start the server locally, locate the app.py file in the root directory and run `python app.py`. This will deploy a local version of the application to localhost:5000.
