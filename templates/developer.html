      <h4>Querying for a certain type of house</h4>
      <p>Our database has a lot of information stored about each property added to the application. We want you to be able to get results from our database that are the most relevant to you. Below is a table containing the fields from our database that you can use to make a query. It's very important that you match the case of the filter field or we won't be able to process your query! Refer to the tables above.</p>
        <table class="table">

      <p>Each query requires that you select a field to filter on, a value for that field, and the number of results you want to see at a time. Let's walk through an example. Let's say you want information for 10 houses in our database that have three bedrooms. Your URL would look like this:</p>
      <code>https://ourhouse-stage.herokuapp.com/houseData/&ltYour API Key goes here&gt/&ltFilterBy&gt=&ltFilterValue&gt/&ltNumber of Responses&gt</code><br><br>
      <p>And an example curl command would looke like this:</p>
      <code>curl -i -X GET https://ourhouse-stage.herokuapp.com/houseData/&ltYour API Key goes here&gt/&ltFilterBy&gt=&ltFilterValue&gt/&ltNumber of Responses&gt</code><br><br>
      <p>An example would look like this:</p>
      <code>https://ourhouse-stage.herokuapp.com/houseData/ABCDEFG1234/Zipcode=02155/3</code>
      <br><br>
      <p>And an example response to that request would look like this:</p>
      <code>[{"City": "Medford", "ParkingSpots": 1, "MonthlyRent": 2900, "Longitude": -71.11761260000003, "Zipcode": "02155", "State": "MA", "UtilitiesIncluded": false, "Pets": false, "LandlordId": 2, "Latitude": 42.4166637, "DistFromCC": 0.779666967374512, "Laundry": true, "Address1": "23 Curtis St.", "Address2": "", "Rooms": 4, "Id": 4}, {"City": "Medford", "ParkingSpots": 1, "MonthlyRent": 2700, "Longitude": -71.12299109999998, "Zipcode": "02155", "State": "MA", "UtilitiesIncluded": true, "Pets": false, "LandlordId": 2, "Latitude": 42.4125732, "DistFromCC": 0.510050941380327, "Laundry": true, "Address1": "300 Boston Ave", "Address2": "Apt. 3", "Rooms": 3, "Id": 5}, {"City": "Medford", "ParkingSpots": 1, "MonthlyRent": 2700, "Longitude": -71.12299109999998, "Zipcode": "02155", "State": "MA", "UtilitiesIncluded": true, "Pets": true, "LandlordId": 2, "Latitude": 42.4125732, "DistFromCC": 0.510050941380327, "Laundry": true, "Address1": "300 Boston Ave", "Address2": "Apt 3", "Rooms": 3, "Id": 6}]</code>
      <h4>Querying for a certain type of house</h4>
      <p>In order to access the reviews related to a particular house, you will need the unique ID associated with that property. This means that you'll need to use query our API to access all the data about a property, and then use the ID to query for reviews. Below is an example of a correct query for reviews.</p>
